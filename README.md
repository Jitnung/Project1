[Github repo title: Project1]

SUMMARY: This is my first assigned project at General Assembly (Singapore), as part of a 12-week Data Science Immersive course. The project involves creating a series of Python lists and dictionaries around the "Pokemon Go/Stay" theme. Questions range from reading csv files, for loops, list/dictionary comprehension, and basics in statistics and probabilities.
